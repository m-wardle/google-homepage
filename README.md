From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

In this assignment, I was tasked with creating a non-functioning replica of the Google homepage. This was much tougher than I expected compared to previous exercises, and I felt that a lot of it was cobbled together haphazardly with a lot of trial and error. Much of what I learned and used was invovled with properly setting the positioning of various items, as well as some experimenting with hover effects. 

In the future I hope to clean up my code a bit more and have a more efficient structure to things.
